# 🚀 GitHub Actions Setup for iOS Cloud Builds

## 📋 What We've Accomplished

✅ **iOS App Built** - Complete Serpent Element AI iOS app  
✅ **Code Pushed to GitHub** - All files in `cursor/build-ios-app-with-ai-api-on-linux-a6c2` branch  
✅ **Remote Installation Package** - Ready for iPhone deployment  
✅ **GitHub Actions Workflow** - Prepared but needs manual setup  

## 🔧 Next Steps: GitHub Actions Setup

### Step 1: Add GitHub Actions Workflow

Since we can't add workflow files via push (permissions issue), you need to add it manually:

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**: https://github.com/fillingp/SerpentElement
2. **Switch to branch**: `cursor/build-ios-app-with-ai-api-on-linux-a6c2`
3. **Create `.github/workflows/` directory**
4. **Add new file**: `ios-build.yml`
5. **Copy content from**: `ios-build-workflow.yml` (in repository root)

### Step 2: Configure Repository Secrets (Optional)

For advanced features, add these secrets in GitHub Settings → Secrets:

```
APPLE_ID - Your Apple ID email
APPLE_PASSWORD - App-specific password
CERTIFICATE_P12 - Base64 encoded certificate
PROVISIONING_PROFILE - Base64 encoded profile
```

### Step 3: Trigger Build

Once workflow is added:

1. **Push any change** to trigger build
2. **Or use manual trigger** in Actions tab
3. **Monitor build progress** in GitHub Actions
4. **Download IPA** from build artifacts

## 📱 Remote iPhone Installation Options
